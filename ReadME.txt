In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a program that would take a random query point, and find the one nearest negighbour to it(given a graph of biconnected points).

The following respository contains the files needed to run the GraphA1NN program, as well as a pdf containing the results of the program given different 
inputs: GraphA1NN.java, UndirectedGraph.java, LabelledPoint.java, PointSet.java, PriorityQueue1.java, sift_base.fvecs, sift_query.fvecs, 
siftsmall_base.fvecs, siftsmall_query.fvecs, knn.txt, knn_3_10_100_10000.txt, Wesley Maya - Programming Assignment #2 Results.pdf, 
and this file (ReadME.txt).
